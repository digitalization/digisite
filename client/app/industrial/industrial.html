		<h2>Industrial automatation</h2>
		<p>
			Digitalization produces SCADA and HMI software for industrial automation projects. In the last few years we have developed a series of new ideas and techniques int he field of industrial software with which the total software development time can be reduced by 40% and modifications or extensions can be implemented more quickly and at less expense. We achieve this by using:

			<ul>
				<li>Hardware simulators which can simulate the machines and their processes in a software environment. This allows us to developt the control software and interfaces from the start of the project, instead of in a later phase when the machines are actually available. The simulators can also be used after project delivery in order to study possible modifications without the need to test on the actual machines. </li>
				<li>Web-based HMI, which allows the user interface to run on any platform (Windows, Mac, Android, etc.) and is easily modified. Another advantage is that it can be run on multiple computers simultaneously and even remotely</li>
				<li>Integration of modern software testing methodologies, including our own Test Suite, which guarantees a robust and well-testes system at delivery.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>SCADA &amp; HMI programmers</h2>
		<p>
			We have educated and experienced SCADA and HMI programmers who can deliver high quality service during the development process. Our web-based HMI's enable remote control and monitoring from one central location. The software can be used with any browser from any computer, without the need for installations or license fees per user.
